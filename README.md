# Comment Plugin

Find the wordpress plugin along with a blank theme for easier display for the form

Install the plugin first then
Create a blank page, and add a shortcode [comment-form]
Lastly, Test if the web page is working.
This is for local testing only. 
Live wordpress is found at https://ethern-comment.x10.mx/wp/
